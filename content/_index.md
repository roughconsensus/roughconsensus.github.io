            <p>
                The digital transformation is accelerating the pace of change in an ever growing range of businesses. The poses enormous opportunities to grow your business by improving your cost effectiveness by an order of magnitude or by opening up new markets that were inaccessible using more traditional go-to-market approaches. However, when you can't keep up with change, it can also become a challenge or an outright threat to your survival.
            </p>
            <p>
                A successful transformation does not solely depend on the selection and implementation of the right technology. Much more important is the adaptation of your business processes and the shift in mindset of your staff.
            </p>
            <p>
                My approach is addressing these three aspects: people, processes and technology. I focus on improving your way of working to make the feedback loop for innovation as short as possible. Your organisation can only improve when your people learn from their actions. This is were a data driven approach marries automation. By building in measurable feedback from the start and automating as much as sensible both your development and your operations, your pace of change increased. That's what I call <em>agility</em>.

            <p>You might wondering what the name of my company is referencing to. I started working as Software Engineer in 1997 for Unisource Business Networks, a joint venture by Swiss Telecom, Telia Sweden and KPN. We built and operated international data networks and I joint the newly founded Internet division. The way of working in our department deviated radically from the practices in the other networking divisions of KPN. As an example, where ISDN was completely drafted by the CCITT before the implementation, the Internet isn't centrally governed. The standards are developed in working groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Within a working group, progress is made by establishing <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2418#page-10" target="_blank">rough consensus</a> and finding proof in the working software. These principles adhere remarkably to the princples defined in the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">agile manifesto</a>.
